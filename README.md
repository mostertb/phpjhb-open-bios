# phpjhb15-open-bios
This is a joke project for attendees of the PHP SA 2016 Community to submit more pull requests

Someone decided that it would be a good idea to have a competition at PHP Craft Johannesburg Conference 2015. Any attendee can enter by submitting a Pull Request... to any open source project. So we created a project :)
